Quick heads up: This tutorial covers Next.js 13, but don't let that number fool you. Next.js 14 is essentially a performance-focused update of version 13. That means every concept, technique, and feature we dive into here is just as applicable and relevant in Next.js 14

üö® Important Updates

‚åõ As of July 11, 2023, Next.js has been updated to version `14.0+.0+`. Even though the video may show an older version, rest assured that the entire application functions seamlessly with the latest Next.js version. You won't encounter any issues while following the video.

‚åõ Starting from October 26, 2023, Next.js server actions have stabilized. Therefore, there's no need to include them in the `next.config.js` file as an experimental feature flag.

‚ö° Error: ClerkInstanceContext not found

Wrap your application in  `layout.tsx`(both in auth and root folders!)

‚ö° Cannot find module "tailwindcss-animate‚Äù

Shadcn requires the `tailwindcss-animate` package to function properly. Do install shadcn first

‚ö° Syntax error: G:\threads\app\globals.css The max-sm: class does not exist. If max-sm: is a custom class, ensure it is defined within a @layer directive. (122:3)

The correct format should be `max-sm:hidden` without any space in between. Please ensure that your code formatter is functioning correctly, as it may sometimes introduce such spaces unintentionally.

‚ö° Clerk 401 Unauthorized error

Ensure you have rightly configured the `middleware.ts/js` file and are using your own envs.

If you encounter any other issues or have questions, please ask in the comments. We're here to help!
